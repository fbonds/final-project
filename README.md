# final-project
UW Javascript 300A final project


## Final Project Requirements

* The project must be a React application, bootstrapped with `create-react-app`
* Your app must be created and visible in a Github repo under your Github account
* Your app must be your own work. 
* Your app should be deployed onto a web server and publicly accessible (unless you decide to use React Native. In that case, it's recommended you use [Expo](https://expo.io/) to share the project).
* Your app should be polished. Some recommendations for this requirement:
  * Remove `console.log` statements once you're finished with development
  * Utilize CSS and images to make your app look great
  * Check for any React errors in the console
  * Perform some basic user testing. Have other people use your app and receive feedback on usability
  * Keep your feature set small, so you'll have time to polish the app
  * Write tests
* If you're feeling adventurous, you can also use React to build mobile apps using the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) framework. Usage is allowed for this project, **but** note that it will involve additional learning and research. Proceed at your own risk.

Other than the above requirements, you're encouraged to be creative and create something you're proud of. It can be as simple or as complex as you want, and it should be high quality.
